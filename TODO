* create a new group for updnotifierd's dbus interface. currently, we
  allow the "users" group to execute methods of
  org.frugalware.UpdNotifier. but this should be changed to some other
  group as suggested by crazy
* fun: implement a mechanism that automatically sets the timeout value
  to the updated interval value as specified by the user without
  requiring to restart fun
