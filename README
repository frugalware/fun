FUN a.k.a Frugalware Update Notifier
====================================

FUN is a client-server application with a sole purpose to notify the 
user of new package updates.

fund (fun daemon) runs in the background waiting for commands from the
client. The fun client is a small application that resides in the user's 
system tray and periodically sends certain commands to the fun daemon to get
information about package updates and other package related information.

The fun daemon (fund) is written in C and uses DBUS for communication. 
The fun client (fun) is written in C using the GTK+ toolkit.

fun is not a DE specific application and it can work on GNOME/XFCE/KDE
or any other DE provided the following requirements are satisfied.

Requirements
============
* pacman-g2 >= 3.6.4
* dbus-glib >= 0.73
* gtk+2 >= 2.12.0
* libglade-2.0 >= 2.6

For Developers
==============
If someone is interested in developing a client for FUN, following are
the services currently provided by FUN daemon.

1) TestService
This command is basically used to test whether the client can connect to
the FUN daemon. Before sending any other commands, make sure you test
connectivity to the daemon using TestService.

2) PerformUpdate
This command checks for package updates. It tells the daemon to perform
a repository sync and check if any updates are available. It returns the
list of available package updates as a string or otherwise NULL.

3) GetPackageInfo
This command is used to get extra information about an available package
update, like it's version, description etc. It accepts one argument, the
package name for which information is needed. It returns two parameters
- the package's latest version and it's description as strings.

NOTE: Service names are subject to change
